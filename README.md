# komBAS Development Environment
Easy and fast setup of a dev environment with Apache, PHP &amp; MySQL

This was done because I always struggled with setting up a usable development environment for my websites **fast**.

# What's inside

This environment consists of two separate containers:

Webserver (Apache with PHP)
MySQL Server (shipped with a fresh test database)
Apache: alpine
PHP: 7.1
MySQL: 5.7

Test Database Name: test
ROOT: root
ROOT-Password: dev
User: dev
User-Password: dev

# Installation and Usage

You need to install Docker first:

https://www.docker.com/community-edition

1. Start Docker
2. Run "up.bat" to start the dev environment
3. Open your browser and navigate to "localhost" for further instructions
4. Run "down.bat" to stop the dev environment
