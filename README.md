# dockerdev
Easy and fast setup of a dev environment with Apache, PHP &amp; MySQL

This was done because I always struggled with setting up a usable development environment for my websites **fast**.

You need to install Docker first:

1. Start Docker
2. Run "up.bat" to start the dev environment
3. Open your browser and navigate to "localhost" for further instructions
4. Run "down.bat" to stop the dev environment
